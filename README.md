The Open65 is an open-source CNC aluminum case for Gondolindrim's [Anticheww 65%](https://github.com/AcheronProject/Anticheww) PCB. The case was designed in Fusion 360, and was designed to be easily manufactured on a 3-axis CNC.

I livestreamed the design in two parts, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWTmy7lN-VI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdywKbIzbng)
